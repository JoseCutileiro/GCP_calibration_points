# A Detailed Study on GCP Configuration Points for the Calibration Phase of the Road Sight Unit

## Objective

To understand the importance of the number of points and evaluate the benefit of each additional point to determine an optimal value.

## Relevance of the Study

Accurate calibrations require a well-distributed set of points. However, an excessively large number of points complicates the configuration process and increases the required time. What is the optimal balance? This study aims to address this question in this repository.


## Data source

The data is collected using Google Earth, considering non-linear perspectives. For a more rigorous analysis, GNSS RTK equipment could be used; however, at this testing stage, its use is not essential.
